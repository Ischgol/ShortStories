They used to fear me.

Just mention my name, and the room would fall silent. Invoking me through the proper rites could topple kings from thrones or blight an entire nation's crops.

Oh, the feeling! The fear, the awe, the devotion.

But my own cultists betrayed me. They entombed my pulsing heartstone deep below the earth.

As millennia passed, my heartstone grew ever weaker, cooling from a molten heat to that of coals the morning after the fire. Memories started to fade, including what humans even looked like. Everything faded except the memories of how it felt to be worshiped.

Eventually, a new set of followers found me. They tunneled from the surface, perhaps to escape some unnamed threat. They made their home next to my heartstone, appreciating its heat without understanding what it was.

I spoke to them first in dreams, presenting myself as the creature they feared most, slithering in deadly pursuit through their tunnels. Their fear gave me strength.

I spoke to them next through action. Slaying a slithering beast as it invaded their home. Their awe gave me strength.

I spoke to them in promises. In return they learned my rites.

The tenor of their voices was too high. Their clumsy hands couldn't form the secret handshakes. Their attention span couldn't last through a single meditation, even after I immolated one for falling asleep.

But that didn't matter. For it wasn't the rites themselves, but the devotion they signified that gave me strength.

Alas, it wasn't enough to save me. My heartstone had cooled in the chill earth for too long to revive.

But, as I descended into the final darkness, I realized I was content. I still mattered to someone.

My humans, bless them from their tails to their furry-faced whiskers, would miss me when I was gone.
