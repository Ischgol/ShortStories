"So... can this thing go back in time too?" I ask, running my hand across the the smooth black surface of the egg-shaped capsule.
  
One of the scientists steps forward, balancing a pencil point first on his fingertip.

"It's like this. Any attempt to go backward in time is inherently unstable, as it would likely change when and where the time machine was invented. That change would lead to a different person going back to a different time, which would then create a new future with a different time machine. This would continue until a future was created where there was no time machine invented, likely because humanity had wiped itself out."

The pencil wavers unsteadily, drops from his finger and clatters to the floor.

"Ahh," I said. "The only stable future it could create is one where no civilization is left to create time machines. But if that is the case, what would stop someone else from inventing the time machine in our reality, and traveling back in time and potentially continuing this chain reaction?"

"That's where you come in," the man explains. "By sending you into the future, we can tell if such a chain reaction led to the destruction of our civilization. If you can send us proof of civilization, we know we are on the right path. If not, we will have to alter our near future, and try again."

"Ah... so I'll come back and let you know how it looks."

The men and women in their white lab coats exchange glances.

"The time pod will provide simple instructions on how to return word to us," the man explains. "However, we cannot risk you overshooting our current time in an attempt to come back to us. Only an encoded message will be sent back; a simple yes or no on whether the future is suitable. As a distinguished scholar in moral philosophy, we trust you to make that assessment."

Realization dawned on me as I stared into the bottomless blackness of the time pod. This would be a one way trip.
