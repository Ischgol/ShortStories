I was the first in line the day "Good or Evil 3" came out. From the new VR system, to the incredible graphics, to the insanely realistic characters, the world was completely immersive. The company claimed they had made a breakthrough in the NPC AI program that made each play through unique, as the NPCs changed based on their interaction with the player and each other.

But the best part was you could do **ANYTHING**.

Want to be good? Sure, you could hunt down bad guys, take them in, get paid a pittance. Rinse and repeat.

I got bored of the "good" route after the first day. The "evildoer" route, on the other hand, was fantastic.

Like a guy's pair of shoes? Mug him in an alley.

Someone mouthing off to you? Maybe its time he didn't bother you, or anyone else, again.

Low on cash? Theres a bank around the corner and the sheriff's on the other side of town.

The only rule I lived by was in my late nights of gaming was, don't get caught. The game kept track of my "murders". When I passed 20 on the fifth day of playing, I got the "serial killer" badge and unlocked a cool new outfit.

The NPCs in my world started to get on edge. They kept talking about the killings, trying to figure out who did them. There were a few who suspected my character, so I offed them.

On Friday, after a long day of work, I slumped onto my couch and threw on my headset, ready to blow off some steam. My mark was the mayor's son, who had managed to woo the girl I had had my eye on. He didn't take me seriously when I told him to back off. According to him, "Jenny can make up her own mind". As if the NPCs actually had a mind!

It didn't take long before I saw the son exit the mayor's house. From the shadows, I aimed my rifle, and took him in the chest with a single blast. Man, that was satisfying!

The doorbell rang. Guess the pizza got here in record time, I thought. I paused the game, pulled off the headset, and walked to my front door, pulling out my wallet.

It wasn't a pizza man standing on the other side of the door. The guy was twitchy, had a beanie pulled partway over his eyes, and kept glancing sideways. His hand was in his jacket pocket. His eyes locked on my wallet.

"Hey man," he said. "I ain't got nothing, I really need a fix. You gotta hand that over."

"You're not the delivery man!" I said. "Get off my..."

It was over in an instant. A loud bang and I peered down to see a red spot getting larger on my chest. I fell backward, felt pain radiate out from my chest, felt my wallet getting pulled from my unresisting hands. Everything went black, then white.

I was standing in a line. Pearly white clouds foaming beneath my feet, a golden gate about a block ahead. Despite the fact that it couldn't be more stereotypical, it took me a minute to realize I was dead and at the gates of heaven.

The line moved forward, and I squinted to see what was happening at the gate. A man with a halo and a full head and beard of gray hair was admitting people through the gate, pausing to check notes on each person before they passed through.

I did a double take. The man at the front of the line looked just like my mark, the mayor's son. As he walked through the gate,  I chalked the similarity up to coincidence or nerves.

Finally it was my turn. Saint Peter, as it seemed based on his polished gold name tag, was frowning at his notes.

"So..." I said. "I know I'm an atheist and all that, but I've given to the poor and help my old neighbor take out her garbage."

"That's not the issue," Peter said, his voice a low rumble. "Plenty of those without faith pass this gate, as long as they have lived a good life."

"Then what's the..." I started.

"Did you think we would not know?" Peter demanded, his voice rising. "Did you think we would not know the people you have killed?"

I racked my brain. Had I inadvertently killed anyone?

"Don't play dumb," Peter went on. "It says here you killed over 20 innocents this week. I just let the last of your victims though the gate not 10 minutes ago."

I barely had time to shout, "No, No!" before Peter reached for a lever on his left side. The clouds beneath my feet disappeared, replaced by a  black hole.

"You don't understand! They're not real, they were never real!" My voice echoed, as I fell down to my eternity.

And then I realized. The breakthrough in AI did more than make the NPCs seem like people, it **MADE** them people.
