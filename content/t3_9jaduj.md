*1000 years ago, scientists found a way to give humans chlorophyll, enabling humans to survive solely on sunlight. Humans evolved and lost the need and instinct to eat.*

A sea of green faces stare up at me in admiration as I jump across the rooftops. My energy is boundless.

It all started with a silly dare to see how many exotic things called "banninnaz" I could fit in by mouth. Being the klutz that I am, I choked. I was about to asphyxiate from lack of carbon dioxide when some latent instinct kicked in and I swallowed the banninna. It was almost as if I was drinking it, except it was solid!

The blood sugar rush hit me 30 minutes later, and I've been jumping around ever since. Although, in the last few minutes I've been getting stomach cramps. Must be a sideache from all that jumping...

Trying to ignore the cramps, I wave cheerfully down at Suzzi. I've had a crush on her since we were just 100.

That is when it hits me; a very peculiar sensation in my lower extremity. Below, a sea of brown faces look up at me in confusion.
