I’ve seen every kind of person you can imagine laid to their final rest. But I’ve only ever seen one wake up.

First, you have to understand something about out town. We pack our deceased with bells. Some priest way back when started the tradition. Idea being, we were all such great Christians that the town cemetery would be ringing the good news come resurrection. Got a little horn coming out of each casket. Some nights, when the breeze is just right, it flows through the horn and tussles the bells. Eerie as fuck, pardon my French.

Second, you should know a bit about Sally. She fell hard for the high school quarterback in senior year. They got married fresh outta school. She got work at the grocer, him doing odd jobs.

Never could hold down a proper job that boy. Though he was pretty good at holding a bottle. Some nights, when he ran out of beers to knock down, he took to knocking down Sally. Town small as this, ya hear things. Wasn’t no secret.

The kicker was the school reunion, year after they graduated. Boy got drunk, but insisted on driving them home. Dumped em both in the river, middle of winter. Came out practically frozen, declared dead by Joseph, the county coroner.

Joseph and I were classmates back in the day. He never did too good in biology class. But somehow, he’s the fancy tootin' coroner and I’m the groundskeeper.

Digging the grave for Sally and her boy was heartbreaking. Funeral was scheduled and over in a jiffy, small town like this. Dropped the bells in, just like we always do.

Wasn’t until old Earl kicked it two months later that I had reason to come back to Sally’s grave. Digging Earl’s hole next to Sally’s, I thought I had a ringing in my ears. Took me a while to realize it was coming from the ground.

The bell? Couldn’t believe it.

Put my ear to the ground and heard muffled screams. Thirty minutes and (all) three cop cars later, we got Sally out.

Called the coroner, this time he declared her alive. Poor thing looked half dead, worse than when we put her in.

“But... but how?!” I remember Joseph stammering.

“It’s been raining the last weeks,” I said. “She must of got air and water through the horn.”

“But what about food?” Joseph asked.

I just pointed to the gravestone, which read:

“Here lies Sally and Jake McDeel, lying together in death as they did in life.”
