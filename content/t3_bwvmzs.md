I never felt comfortable here.

Towering marble columns supporting arched ceilings. My in-laws mansion put the Sistine Chapel to shame. And this was just their summer home.

"Brandon!"

The booming voice of my father in law resonated from the smaller of the great halls. Sighing, I hand my coat to the butler and walked through the foyer.

Three minutes later, I walked into the second great hall to find my wife finishing up dinner with her two parents.

"What did the doctor say, honey?" My beautiful wife asked, her brow furrowed.

"Terminal," I said tersely, hating to have this conversation on front of my parents-in-law. "Unless they can find me a new lung by the end of a year".

To my surprise, my father in-law guffawed. I started at the man, mouth agape.

"Jeeves!" He called.

The silence stretched until, 2 minutes later, Jeeves arrived on a Segway.

"Sir?"

"My new boy here needs a new lung."

The portly butler started at me, his mustache drooping in a frown.

"Blood type, sir?"

"Excuse me?" I stammered.

"Your blood type... Sir." The tone made clear I didn't meet the honorific.

"Uhhh, B negative."

"Very good, sir."

The butler walked out. At a gesture from my father in-law, I sat down. Dessert was served, or rather, desserts.

"So", I ventured carefully, digging my spoon into my bourbon creme brulee, "is Jeeves checking the donor list?"

A titter like birdsong, arose from my mother in law. Her hand fanning a face perched on a thin neck. "Please, Brandon. We make our own luck."

I didn't understand her meaning until, after my third dessert, my phone started to ring. The number was from the surgeon's office.
