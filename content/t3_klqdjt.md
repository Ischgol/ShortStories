The Lost Generation. That’s what we thought of our parents, though in their time they were known as GenX. By the time life extension was developed (and FDA approved) in the late 21st century, they were too far gone to benefit. Aging could be halted, not reversed.

They lived on in our memory, we told ourselves. We thought their memory would live on forever in us. But then we, too, started to age.

It began slowly. A wrinkle here, an achy joint there. Then hard evidence came in the measured shortening of telomeres and the reduced proliferation score of stem cells isolated from tissue samples.

We were aging. Not only that, but the process was accelerating. Within a few years, our hair began to gray.

A black market developed for unproven treatments. Conspiracy theories abounded, each more ridiculous than the last. The government engineered a virus to undo agelessness, Clorox was a cure but the FDA wouldn’t approve it, you get the idea.

And the babies! We were previously known as the childless generation, but as our own mortality threatened, we turned to the empty solace of immortality by association with future generations.

But within 5 years, most women had gone through menopause and most men were less virile. Another 5 years and we hobbled around aimlessly, our minds as fogged as our eyes were rheumy.

Our children were our hope. They could find the cause, and then a solution, we told ourselves. That was until the final shock. Before even the teenage years, their hair started to gray and thin, their skins blemished and wrinkled. Most never made it through puberty, and those that did have children... well, best not to describe what was born.

Our parents had given us immortality, or so we thought. But like most generations, we simply stole from the next. In our case we stole time.

We became known as the Fallen Generation. Our children were know as the Last Generation.
