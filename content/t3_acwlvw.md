We didn't remember who we were, or why we were brought to the world of Akola.

All we knew was that we were blessed with incredible power, and their world was on the brink of destruction.

As the clan priestess, I was often a the rear of the party, providing buffs and healing as needed. When friends fell before my eyes, I always blamed myself. If only I had been faster, smarter, or more powerful.

Our party of 20 became 15, then 10, then 5.

We finally fought our way to the doors of Behelmoth, the necromancer who brought the apocalypse to this world.

He was powerful. The blinding light from my staff slowed his minions, and my healing spells brought our Palladin back from the brink of the abyss. Our mage fell before I could reach him.

So focused was I on my comrades, that I didn't notice the hellhound until it tore into me from behind. Pain mixed with rage as my world went red, then black.

"Is she done?" A voice asked.

Weird, it sounded like Jackass27, our Rogue. But he was killed at the Battle of the Arch.

"I'll take her headset off." Another voice, DemonSlayer69, who died protecting me from a cave troll.

"Wait. Her readout says she's still at 1HP."

I blinked, and opened my eyes and returned to consciousness. The hellhound had left me for dead.

I bandaged my wound, downed a health potion, and surveyed the dungeon. Only our Druid Theonox and I were were left.

"Theolux, I thought we had lost you!" Theonox shouted. He had a gaping wound in his side, and I had run out of healing spells.

"No my love, I am still with you. Though for a moment I was visited by our fallen comrades. I think they are waiting for us from whence we came to this world."

"Then let us finish what we all came here to start," Theolux said.

We turned to the necromancer, fire burning in his eyes. As one, we raised our staffs and charged forward for the last time.
