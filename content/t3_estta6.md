It had been centuries since I was summoned. Last time, the blood of 100 virgins had been sacrificed to call me from the shadow realms. It was barely enough payment for the ask; I killed one king and installed another.

As the long years stretched by, that meager sustenance was wearing thin. Had the humans forgotten me, the greatest of all demons?

My inferior demonic brethren were less fortunate. One by one they succumbed to the final darkness, their screams little more than a faded whisper as their weakened forms turned to dust. I was all that was left. Moloch'ai Terranous, King of the Demons... king of nothing.

So when I finally heard my name through the aether, felt the pull forward the light at the edge of the shadow realms, I wasn't in a state to resist.

Blinking, I surveyed my surroundings. Calling it a pentagram with an altar of blood in the center would be generous. The fact that the penetagram was drawn in chalk and the alter was a stool with a cheap bowl wasn't lost on me, but I wasn't in a position to be picky.

Greedily, I gulped down the blood, feeling power returning. As I drained the bowl I noticed, painted at the bottom of the bowl, a white cat raising it's paw as if in greeting. Strange... Perhaps it was some minor deity of this new age.

I turned my attention to the summoner, and was surprised to see a little girl, barely 12 years old, if that.

"What virgin blood is this?" I asked. It had tasted a bit different.

Shaking, the girl held out a container, which read: "Cruelty Free Vegan Blood Substitute TM".

"What is this?" I mused.

On the back was an ingredient list, which included "leghomoglobin from budding yeast."

"Is Yeast a virgin?" I demanded of the girl.

The girl shrank back in fear. "Miss Green said yeast reproduces asexually," She offered hopefully.

I could tell she was telling the truth, and couldn't fault her logic. I decided the contract was fulfilled.

"Why have you summoned me?"

"I... I need help at school. This girl Tracy is picking on me."

"Then I shall rend her into pieces and drink her blood! Will that be enough?"

"No!" The girl looked shocked.

"...I can also kill each of her closest friends and curse her family for generations." I offered hopefully.

"No!" The girl was sheet white. "I just want you to talk to her mom, and convince her to stop Tracy from picking on me."

She handed me a slip of paper. My demon senses tingled with foreboding; this would be my most difficult battle yet. On the paper was an appointment for a meeting with the principal and Tracy's mom, Karen Miller.

~-~-~

The morning light shone through the attic windows. Jenna, the girl who summoned me, was sitting on the ancient tome she found in the attic, which had taught her how to summon me. We had been up all night, planning.

When I heard all the injustices Tracy had put my Jenny through, my blood started to boil. Jenny even had to slide a few feet away to avoid the heat.

It didn't stop at name calling. Tracy had spilled lunch trays on Jenny, sabotaged Jenny's audition to the cheerleading squad, and cheated with Jenny's boyfriend. I was most concerned about the boyfriend until I learned that Jenny had only held hands with the boy. I made a mental note to deal with him later.

Every time I tried to suggest a more direct solution to the Tracy problem, Jenny insisted we use diplomacy.

As the school bus arrived, I transformed into a hell cat. Well... actually a hell kitty. Jenny had been insistent on that as well, forcing me to use the form of the small white cat that adorned her room. Some sort of sacred animal, I believe. She even gave me a tiny red ceremonial hat.

Jenny placed me in her backpack. I noticed the hell kitty demigod design was on her backpack as well.

It wasn't long before Tracy joined Jenny on the bus. "Hey stupid!" she exclaimed, thrusting herself onto the seat beside Jenny.

The verbal assaults continued, each less clever than the last. Under the seat, I stretched a leg out and sprayed urine on Tracy's backpack. Hell cat urine does not wash out.

On her way to class, Jenny released me from the backpack into an unused classroom. Smoke billowed as I transformed into a tall, handsome man in a suit. I walked across the hall to the principal's office, and introduced myself as Jenny's father with a striking smile.

The principal was flushed and stuttering as she invited me to sit. Minutes later, I heard a voice outside that rang with authority.

"It's infuriating that I have to take time out of my day to deal with these senseless accusations against my daughter!" The door opened, and Karen strode in, the janitor trailing behind with her briefcase.

"Put it there," Karen ordered without so much as a thank you. The man shuffled to comply, then rushed off before Karen could think of anything else for him to do.

Karen was holding Tracy's backpack. I started as I realized that the backpack no longer smelled. What new magic was this? I decided it must be the wand, inscribed with the incantation "Tide", which Karen slipped back into her purse. So, Karen was a sorceress, and a powerful one at that.

To be continued...
