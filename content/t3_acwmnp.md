They thought I was crazy. But I had tested my materials, and they were of the finest quality.

The shell was impervious to the friction of re-entry. The thrusters had only the most powerful jet fuel, a carbonated concoction specially developed for the mission. The steering system was state of the art.

With a double ply corrugated cardboard body, soda cans for thrusters, and a frisbee as the steering wheel, what could go wrong?

Unfortunately, I did have to kidnap the prime minister. They would have tried to stop me otherwise. People were always afraid of progress.

With a magic marker I put the finishing touches on my spaceship, adding lights on the wings, and writing "C&H" in big, bold letters on the side.

I also stashed a bag of chips in the cockpit. It would be a long flight to Saturn after all, and I might get hungry.

"Are you ready, Mr. Prime minister?" I asked.

"No! I'm scared of heights," said Hobbes.

"Too late. 3, 2, 1, liftoff!"
