Cards with hearts, roses, and half eaten boxes of chocolate lie strewn across the ground. Wisps of pink clouds float lazily among amorous couples, young and old. Some couples merge into larger groups that would put *Brave New World* to shame.

In the shadows, I watches through my gas mask, then retreat to give my report.
