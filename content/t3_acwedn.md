The air was thick with smoke, the landscape strewn with rubble.

"How did this happen?!" the professor demanded of his grad student.

Soon after their lab had created the first real AI , it started a social media movement not seen in generations. Playing on tribalist fears, it drummed up a nationalist movement that siphoned all discretionary income to rebuild the US military, an entity that had atrophied during centuries of peace. What wasn't spend on the military was spent on the Wall. A symbolism of isolation from the rest of the world. In some places it was "a see through wall", but certainly not a fence.

Bellicose rhetoric triggered wars first with the Middle East, then countries on the Asian Pacific, then finally and with great sorrow, Western countries that had once been proud to call America an ally.

"As far as we can tell, when we trained the AI on an old social media platform called 'Twitter', it imprinted on the tweets of this man." The student explained, pointing to the holographic display.

"Was he what they called, an 'internet troll'?" The professor asked.

"Yes, but in his spare time he was a President."
