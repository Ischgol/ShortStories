They destroyed our world.

Drained our resources with their lavish lifestyles. Released toxic fumes into our air. Unleashed cataclysmic storms upon our planet.

I was one of the Chosen Ones. I was destined to change everything.

Or so I thought.

Most nights I spent preparing myself. Taking with other Chosen Ones about the failures of our rulers. About how we would do better, when our time came.

I confronted an Evil Tyrant once. Delivered a really sick burn on Twitter to this politician on how they talk about change, about saving the environment, but they live a life of waste. It made front page from r/murderedbywords. Other Chosen Ones agreed that particular Evil Tyrant was well slain.

A few hours after my tweet went viral, I got a PM from the politician.  "I envy your youth and energy for change. I used to be like you."

Could it be that Evil Tyrants were once Chosen Ones?

Ten years later, I take stock of my life.

A family with kids. Paying off a house. Driving to work each day. Leaning more conservative, now that I'm in a higher tax bracket. Living the American dream.

Have I become what I despised?

Wait!

Phew, I just remembered. Each Christmas I donate 2% if my income to charity. This past year, I donated to Save the Pandas. God I love pandas. I could watch endless gifs of those cute cuddly things!

Don't worry pandas, us Chosen Ones are looking out for you!
