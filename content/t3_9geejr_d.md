Why couldn't it have been me?

That was the only thought in my mind as I dragged my son's mangled body from the wreckage of the car I had crashed.

It was the thought running through my head as we said our farewells at his funeral, later as I was sentenced to involuntary manslaughter, and every day I spent in jail since.

It was the thought foremost in my mind when my wife visited me in jail. For the first time since the crash, I saw hope in her eyes.

We had decided to have our son's body preserved, frozen. Not because we ever expected future medicine could save him, but because we couldn't fully let him go.

Now modern medicine had a solution; while they still couldn't fix our son's body, they could scan his brain and overwrite his mind onto another brain, in another body. The procedure was risky and imperfect, but what father wouldn't try anything to save his son?

It should have been me, I tell myself as they strap be into the machine.

It should have been me.

I repeat that mantra, as the lights dim, as the machine whirrs to life, as my vision goes fuzzy, then dark.

"I should have been me!" I cry out, jerking upright in bed. My mom sits next to me, holding my hand.

"Mom, I had a bad dream."

"It's OK honey, you're here and safe. That's all that matters."

As she hugs me, I look around the strange room. In the reflection of a window, my father's face stares back at me.
