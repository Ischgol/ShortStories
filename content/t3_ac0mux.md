"[MALSJÖ](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60327774/)," I said. Or tried to say, given I had no idea how an "O" with two dots above was pronounced.

The lights dimmed and flickered. Everyone else in the vicinity slowed to a standstill as if frozen in time.

The black TV unit I was considering started to shake and change shape. Bulbous eyes bulged out of the top. The frame rounded and the front sliding glass panels fell out, revealing a gaping maw housing an inky blackness that looked bottomless.

The thing roared, its eyes fixing on me. "Get in my belly." I felt, more than heard the words. I stumbled back and fell, and the thing advanced toward me. It crouched and leapt... and crashed into an invisible barrier that flickered brightly for an instant, then disappeared again.

"Demonslayer to the living room department," the intercom said. "Demonslayer, living room department."

In disbelief, I looked around. A young woman in an oversized IKEA shirt and holding a glowing sword was running toward me. I ducked as she jumped over me. The invisible field didn't seem to have an effect on her, and she buried her sword in one of the demon's eyes.

But that didn't stop it. With a roar of pain and rage, it opened its mouth wider, if that were possible, and inhaled.

With a shout, the IKEA worker gabbed ahold of a nearby bed frame, her legs getting sucked into the things mouth.

I shouted a wordless cry of confused anger, and ran toward the demon from the side. Passing through the invisible field raised the hair on my skin, and of a sudden I could feel the wind from the demon's inhale. As my feet slid closer to the beast, I grabbed the sword, pulling it out of the one eye and stabbing it into the second. Finally, the demon lay still, defeated.

"Good job!" the IKEA girl shouted excitedly, limping over to me. "This one will make a great harvest."

"Wha... WHAT?" I asked. The people around us reanimated as if nothing had happened.

"OK, short version first." She said. "Some of these pieces of furniture are named after demons we found named in an ancient scroll. Unfortunately, we don't know how to pronounce the names, so we leave it to customers to find the right name by trial and error."

"But what about the invisible barrier?"

"Oh that! Well, the twists and turns of the customer path in IKEA form a pentagram of human blood. Though technically the human blood is still contained in the living humans themselves, which is preferable."

"And when you slay a demon, you harvest it?" I asked.

"Oh yes! The black market for demon parts is very lucrative. We couldn't maintain our low furniture prices without subsidizing it with demon sales."

"One last question," I said. "Are you taking demonslayer applications?"

"Well, you did prove yourself just now," she said, eyeing me up and down. "I'll put in a word with the manager. We might even start you above minimum wage."

"I'll take what I can get."
