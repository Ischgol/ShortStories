The dim light of the fridge drove the sleep from my eyes as I rummaged through the top shelf for the last bit of milk. Finally finding it, I sniffed the contents. Good enough. I tipped it in to my bowl of cereal, pleased to see that I had enough milk left for that perfect cereal-to-milk ratio. As I turned to grab a spoon, I came face-to-face with a masked person. My blood turned cold as I recognized the mask from news footage earlier in the day. The so-called photo bomber took a selfie with her victims after killing them. Without thinking, I hurled my bowl of cereal at the face. The mask shattered, and the photo bomber fell to the ground, a long shard of the mask piercing her eye. I stood shaking, part of me irrationally upset that I didn't have any milk left to make another snack. I don't plan to start a streak, but I am now a cereal killer.
