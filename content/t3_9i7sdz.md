The first time was an accident. I'm ashamed to admit I fled the scene after I hit him. Hosed the car down in the driveway, tried to pretend it never happened.

I chalked up the ensuing dreams up to guilt. Memories of another life. Memories of a kind and better man than I. Memories I thought I had imagined for the man I had hit...until I read his obituary. Turns out, all those memories were actually real. Memories from a loving father, devoted husband, and passionate scientist.

The memories became more meaningful than my own, perhaps because the life of the man I had killed was better lived than mine. That was when I realized I wanted to take more lives, and gain experiences from every walk of life.

My first and only victim was the week after. She backed up the alley as I closed in. I could hear the fear in her voice as she called for help.

"Not this way." I somehow knew the voice in my head was not my own; it was the voice of the man I had killed.

Now I am in Oregon. Under their death with dignity act, I help those who have lived a full life and are in terminal stages of illness. I am the one who takes then off life support.

Those who believe in my ability often request me specifically. In a way, they live on through me. In return, I try to share their wisdom with the world.
