I didn't notice the signs until it was almost too late.

The soft hum of the fridge must have masked the squeak of the window as it was pried open and the footsteps of the approaching intruder. The light of the fridge in midnight darkness blinded me to any soft shadows cast by my visitor.

It wasn't until I felt the cool press of a steel blade on my neck that I fully woke up. My reflexes were getting slow.

"Hello," I said conversationally.

"...I'm here to take your life." The voice was low, raspy, and sounded forced. Like Ben Affleck playing Batman.

"Ok, here's the thing," I said. "I'm a bit peckish, and would hate to die on an empty stomach. You've probably worked up an appetite prowling around all night. And I make an awesome panini. Why don't I cook something up, we grab a bite, and if I can't change your mind after you finish your sandwich, you can go ahead and kill me?"

A long pause.

"...Ok," my visitor finally relented. He sounded a bit put out. His voice was a few octaves higher than before; more natural.

"Do you mind?" I asked the second time his blade nicked my neck. He backed off a little, and I was able to finish the sandwiches, adding a bit of extra sauce for good measure.

"You'll appreciate my homemade sauce," I assured him. "What'll you drink?"

"Milk, if you have any."

Good God! I finally took a look at my intruder. Round face, tousled hair, smooth skin. He couldn't be over 16.

Wordlessly, I slid his plate and drink into the table, and sat down to my own plate.

"So, do you have a name for your serial killer identity?" I asked.

"Not really..."

"Have you thought about one?"

"No."

"How do you kill your victims?"

"I dunno. I just kinda sneak up behind them and cut their throats."

"... And then?"

"I leave."

"Nothing more creative than that? What's your reason for getting into this business?"

"I never really liked people."

"That's it?! You must be the most basic, boring, uninspired serial killer I've ever met!"

"Look," he said, his voice going husky again. "I don't have to take this abuse. I held up my end of the deal, and you failed to change my mind." He ate the last crumbs off his plate, and drained his glass of milk.

Unsteadily, he came to his feet. On the second step around the table, he collapsed, knife clattering to the floor.

"What did you do to me?" The panic in his voice sounded sweet to my ears.

"Well, I tried to help you form your identity as a serial killer. Was thinking of taking an apprentice soon. But man! You have nothing to work with. I can't justify wasting any antidote on you."

His face froze in a rictus of fear and confusion.

I stood up, stretched, and walked over to the fridge, opening the freezer section. Severed heads stared hollowly back at me. There was still enough room for another.

Sighing, I walked toward the garage to grab my bone saw and a plastic tarp.

No rest for the weary. And all this on my night off.
