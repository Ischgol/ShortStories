I tried to shave, I really did. But every time I raised a razor to my face, my beard slapped it away.

It wouldn't move when others were watching. They looked at me strange when I tried to explain it. My friend group shrank, then disappeared.

My beard was lecherous, grabbing female colleagues from behind. Soon I was out of a job and on the streets.

One time, a bystander tried to help. He brought me a package including soap, a blanket, and a razor.

"If you clean yourself up, you might be able to get a job," he said.

An idea occurred to me. If my beard didn't move when others watched, maybe I could shave in front of this man. He seemed bemused by my request, but followed me into the bathroom at Starbucks.

As I brought the razor to my face, my beard twitched.

"What the-" The man gasped, but didn't get a chance to finish his sentence. My beard grabbed the razor and wrapped around his head, embedding the razor in his jugular.

I tried to run for help, but the cops assumed I was the culprit. The jury sentenced me to prison. For 10 years, I stewed on how the world had turned its back on me.

After those 10 long years, I was finally on parole. My beard now reached my knees. And the best part was, I now saw no reason to hold it back.
