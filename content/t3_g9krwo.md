“Is everything OK with my child?”

“Your child will be fine, pretty much by definition. Oh, he’ll have tremendous struggles and go through more life-threatening situations than a group of Trump supporters drinking Clorox, but his particular condition will ensure he makes it through. Unfortunately, his condition also ensures he grows up as an orphan.”

“I don’t understand...”

“I don’t know how else to say this. Your child has Protagonist Syndrome.”

*gasp* “Is there anything I could have done?”

“Well, your records state the father was a being of light so... maybe not indulging in a one night stand with a demigod?”

“Oh. Well. What are my chances?”

“Usually the parent has only a few days, occasionally up to a few years. The latter allows for the protagonist to form early memories that can make the loss of a parent even more tragic. But in those cases, the parents death is usually in some traumatizing event.”

“That’s awful!”

“Yes, but we are developing a experimental treatment.”

“What is it?”

“In some cases, it has been sufficient for the parent to seem to die, only to step back into the plot during the protagonist’s adulthood. Unfortunately, there’s one catch.”

“What’s that?”

“You’ll need to be the Villain.”

“You mean like Anakin turning into Darth Vader after Padame died?”

“That’s correct.”

“Noooooooooo!”
